<h2>DDL and DML:</h2>
<p>DDL and DML are two types of commands used to create and manage a database. 
DDL commands help define the structure of the database, while DML commands manipulate the data within it. 
By using these commands, users can create and organize a database, as well as insert, update, delete, and retrieve data from it. 
In simpler terms, DDL and DML are used to build and interact with a database.</p>
<h2>Assignment 7 Research Summarized:</h2>
<p>Yahtzee is a popular dice game where players roll five dice in an attempt to score points by achieving 
various combinations. These combinations are determined by the number of dice showing a specific number or 
the sequence of the numbers rolled.
Creating a Yahtzee game with JavaScript will be a bit challenging. 
The game involves a lot of logic for determining the score based on the combinations of the rolled dice. 
However, with the right resources and knowledge of JavaScript, it is definitely possible to create a functional 
Yahtzee game.
To create a Yahtzee game with JavaScript, you will need to create the interface for the game, handle the user's 
input for rolling the dice and selecting which dice to keep, and then calculate the score for each turn. 
You will also need to keep track of the player's total score and display it at the end of each game.
Overall, creating a Yahtzee game with JavaScript can be a fun and challenging project for those who 
are interested in learning more about web development and programming.</p>
