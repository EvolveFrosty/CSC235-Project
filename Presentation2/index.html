    <p>In conclusion, completing the CSC235 course has been a valuable experience that 
	has equipped us with the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in the field of web development. 
	We have learned how to design and implement digital products, build and manage databases, utilize 
	frameworks for web applications, and create responsive and visually appealing web pages. 
	Through the various assignments and projects, we have also gained experience working collaboratively 
	and problem-solving in real-world scenarios. As we move forward, we are excited to apply what we have
